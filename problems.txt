1). in store word instructions when store bytes or half words 
how the rest of the bits should be filled. don't care or 0.

2). when should pipeline registers updated? within the end of the current cock cycle or
    the posedge of the next clock cycle.
    if pipeline registers are configured to posedge of clock cycle there should be time delay after that the other modules 
    should work. 

3) pipeline register read and write #1 and register file write #4. is this acceptable. if pipeline register read and write is
   larger than this then no problem occur and no need to configure to negative edge to occur write operation
